[],"“PMO should become an institution of service and the People's PMO”

“Entire nation has faith in this team”

“Together, we will achieve the target of ‘Nation First’ with the intention of Viksit Bharat 2047”

“We must take the nation to the heights no other nation has ever achieved”

“These elections put a stamp of approval on the efforts of government employees”

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has taken charge of the Prime Minister’s Office today. Addressing the officers and staff of the Prime Minister’s Office, Shri Modi asserted that it has been an endeavour to make the PMO an institution of service and the People's PMO from the very beginning. “We have tried to develop the PMO as a catalytic agent which becomes a source of new energy and inspiration”, the Prime Minister said.

Prime Minister Modi said that the Government means new energy of strength, dedication and resolve and expressed confidence that the PMO is primed to serve the people with dedication. He highlighted that it is not Modi alone who runs the government but thousands of minds that come together and shoulder the responsibilities, and as a result, it is the citizens who become witnesses to the magnificence of its abilities.

Shri Modi underlined that the people who belong to his team have no time constraints, limits to thinking or any set benchmarks for effort. “Entire nation has faith in this team”, the Prime Minister said.

The Prime Minister took the opportunity to thank those who have been a part of his team and also exhorted those who wish to join and become a part of the journey of Viksit Bharat for the next 5 years and dedicate themselves to nation-building. “Together, we will achieve the target of ‘Nation First’ with one intention of Viksit Bharat 2047”, the Prime Minister said. He also reiterated that his every moment belongs to the nation.

Prime Minister Modi explained that the combination of desire and stability makes for determination while success is achieved when determination is complemented by hard work. He further added that if one’s wish is stable, it takes the form of a resolution whereas a wish that constantly takes new forms is merely a wave.

The Prime Minister expressed the desire to take the nation to new heights and exhorted his team to breach the global benchmark while outperforming the work done for the past 10 years in the future. “We must take the nation to the heights no other nation has ever achieved”, Shri Modi exclaimed.

PM Modi highlighted that the prerequisites of success are clarity of thought, faith in conviction and character to act. “If we have these three things, then I don't believe failure will be anywhere near”, he added.

The Prime Minister credited the employees of the Government of India who dedicated themselves to a vision and said that they deserve a huge share in the government’s achievements. “These elections put a stamp of approval on the efforts of government employees”, PM Modi said. He encouraged the team to develop new ideas and boost the scale of the work being done. The Prime Minister concluded the address by throwing light on the secret of his energy and said that a successful person is one that keeps the student within him alive.

NEW DELHI (AP) — Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared victory for his alliance in India’s general election, claiming a mandate to move forward with his agenda, even though his party lost seats to a stronger than expected opposition, which pushed back against his mixed economic record and polarizing politics.

“Today’s victory is the victory of the world’s largest democracy,” Modi told the crowd at his party’s headquarters Tuesday, saying Indian voters had “shown immense faith” both in his party and his National Democratic Alliance coalition.

Official results from India’s Election Commission on Wednesday showed the NDA won 294 seats, more than the 272 seats needed to secure a majority but far fewer than had been expected.

For the first time since his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it did not secure a majority on its own, winning 240 seats — far fewer than the record 303 it won in the 2019 election.

That means Modi will need the support of other parties in his coalition — a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory. During campaigning, Modi said his party would likely win 370 seats and his allies another 30 seats.

He now depends on the support of key allies, including the Telugu Desam Party in southern Andhra Pradesh state with 16 seats and Janata Dal (United), which won 12 seats in eastern Bihar state, as well as smaller groups.

“Indian voters can’t be taken for granted,” said the Times of India newspaper in an editorial. “Voters have clearly indicated that jobs and economic aspirations matter. The economic message from the results is that jobs matter.”

The Congress party won 99 seats, improving its tally from 52 in the 2019 elections. Among its key allies, Samajwadi Party won 37 seats in northern Uttar Pradesh state in a major upset for the BJP; All India Trinamool Congress bagged 29 seats in West Bengal state; and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam 22 seats in southern Tamil Nadu state.

The opposition INDIA coalition won a total of 232 seats.

The BJP may now be “heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,” said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“At the very least, the result pricks the bubble Prime Minister Modi’s authority. He made this election about himself,” said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a political commentator. “Today, he is just another politician, cut to size by the people,” he said in an article in The Indian Express daily.

More than 640 million votes were cast in the marathon election held over a span of six weeks in the world’s largest democratic exercise.

In the face of the surprising drop in the BJP’s support, challengers claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a “moral and political loss” for Modi.

“This is public’s victory and a win for democracy,” Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.

Despite the setback, Modi pledged to make good on his election promise to turn India’s economy into the world’s third biggest, from its current fifth place, and not shirk with pushing forward with his agenda.

He said he would advance India’s defense production, boost jobs for youth, raise exports and help farmers, among other things.

“This country will see a new chapter of big decisions. This is Modi’s guarantee,” he said, speaking in the third person.

Many of the Hindu nationalist policies he’s instituted over the last 10 years will also remain locked in place.

Modi’s win was only the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first prime minister. Before Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years.

Congratulations for Modi from leaders of regional countries including neighboring Nepal and Bhutan flowed in, while the White House commended India for its “vibrant democratic process.”

In his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India’s political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.

His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India’s standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance while the economy, one of the world’s fastest-growing, has become more unequal.

For Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India’s vast number of people living in poverty.

“People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,” Payal said. “This is a big deal for us. If we don’t wake up now, when will we?”

Rahul Gandhi, the main face of the opposition Congress party, said he saw the election numbers as a message from the people.

“The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,” he told a news conference.

Modi’s popularity has outstripped that of his party’s during his first two terms in office, and he turned the parliamentary election into one that more resembled a presidential-style campaign, with the BJP relying on the leader’s brand.

“Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,” said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.

Under Modi’s government, critics say India’s democracy has come under increasing strain with strong-arm tactics used to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.

Economic discontent has also simmered under Modi. While stock markets have reached record-highs, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.

As polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on “Modi’s guarantees,” highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With Modi at the helm, “India will become a developed nation by 2047,” he repeated in rally after rally.

But the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.

The opposition INDIA alliance attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.

“These issues have resonated and made a dent,” added Aiyar, the public policy scholar.",Modi claims victory in India’s election but drop in support forces him to rely on coalition partners,https://apnews.com/article/india-election-results-2024-lok-sabha-modi-bjp-7893efecc83fa8225a611f174e6420ee

Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the most seats—more than the entire opposition alliance combined—but will need the help of coalition allies to form a government.

What will the surprising election results mean for politics in India and for India’s place in the world? I spoke with two experts on FP Live: Milan Vaishnav, the director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and Yamini Aiyar, the former president of New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research. Subscribers can watch the full discussion on the video box atop this page or download the FP Live podcast. What follows is a condensed and lightly edited transcript.

Ravi Agrawal: There was a wide expectation that Modi would return to power in a landslide. He didn’t. What went wrong?

Milan Vaishnav: If we rewind the clock to January and February of this year, before voting began, every pre-election survey pointed in one direction. And that was an overwhelming majority for the BJP, plus seats for the BJP’s allies known as the NDA. Exit polls reconfirmed that as recently as June 1. But that’s not what we saw. We saw a BJP that fell short of a governing majority. It will only be in power thanks to the help and assistance of its coalition partners.

The overarching message or takeaway for me was that it really wasn’t clear what this election was about. It’s such an obvious question to ask, but I have no answer for it. And this really hurt the BJP. There was no defining economic, national security, emotive issue. And what ended up happening, in broad strokes, was more of a classic state-by-state contest where local factors, incumbency, caste equations, party dynamics, alliances mattered much more. The BJP is on much weaker ground there. They have been the incumbent for 10 years. They have a motley group of opposition parties which have banded together with the explicit purpose of keeping the BJP out of power. There was some upset within the BJP’s ranks. They replaced over 100 of their sitting MPs, bringing in defectors and turncoats from other parties. This is important because the BJP is a rank-and-file, cadre-based party, so they don’t necessarily take very kindly to people coming from the outside. And so they really struggled to do something that we think of as part of the BJP’s strength, which is crafting a narrative.

But it was really the opposition, on the campaign trail, which was very disciplined in its messaging, hitting the government hard on the state of the economy, inequality, social injustice. And unlike opposition campaigns of the past, they stayed on message. They were nimble and they were very clever. It was the first time in a while when you saw opposition social media ads and you laughed out loud because of how cutting they were.

RA: Yamini, there’s been a lot of commentary about how democracy has been challenged in India. Do the results show that democracy is, in fact, alive and well in India?

Yamini Aiyar: Every poll and, frankly, everybody from elites and opinion-makers to opposition parties and people out of the ivory towers had the same sense that Modi is going to come back. It was, in fact, on the back of that confidence that they coined the phrase “Char Sau Paar,” meaning this time we will cross more than 400 [seats in parliament]. Five hundred and forty-three is the total number of seats, so if you hit 400, you’ve achieved hegemonic dominance.

At the start of the campaign, a set of actions was taken by the government that gave a sense that dominance was now full and complete. In January, there was the consecration of the Ram Temple, a long-standing contestation around India’s secularism and Hindu identity, in which it looked like the Hindu national narrative had won. The prime minister was a sole priest, publicly and visibly participating as the key actor in the consecration ceremony. All over the city, people celebrated this huge achievement of what had really been the heart and soul of the struggle of the Hindu nationalist movement through the ’80s and ’90s, which was when they rose.

The slide into authoritarianism had begun a long time ago, but it accelerated in some ways in those two months before the elections, hitting a crescendo when one of the leading opposition voices was jailed days before the campaign officially began. The Congress Party, the leading opposition party, comes out saying, “Our accounts have been frozen.” And in the backdrop of this, several other politicians have investigative agencies chase after them, civil society is completely curbed. There was a sense that there is no space for active political contestation, that dominance has been achieved, that this election was going to be won before it even began. And then the campaign started.

As the campaign unfolded, the BJP had one national agenda. So I disagree with you, Milan. There was a national agenda. It’s just that agenda wasn’t as exciting to all voters. The national agenda was Modi, Modi’s charisma, Modi’s personality, Modi’s omnipresence, his mesmerizing charm, the spell that he had cast on the Indian voter over these last 10 years. And it was Modi’s guarantee, which is the title of the BJP manifesto. Modi was the sole and only campaigner.

The opposition, which was struggling to figure out how to create cohesion, was listening and engaging in some remarkable ways. The first and most important thing was the economy, as Milan mentioned. People wanted to hear from the BJP what they had to say about the two things that were hurting them the most, particularly in north India, which was unemployment and, linked to that, inflation. Early in the campaign, some BJP leaders, perhaps in their hubris, let out that there was some thinking about changing the constitution. And that is why they needed total dominance. The Indian electorate was already beginning to wonder about this total dominance. This idea of “crossing 400” had a sense of arrogance that was beginning to become uncomfortable. And you saw this in the growing emergence of social media influencers who were really hitting out at the authoritarian tendencies of the government. Their numbers started rising, a sign that voters were looking for something else. This, combined with this challenge to the constitution, became a live issue which the opposition was able to harness into a cohesive narrative and link it very interestingly to caste politics. Suddenly, caste was back in contention because the constitution was written by B. R. Ambedkar, who is a very important figure for lower-caste politics in India. But also the constitution contains hard-fought rights linked to reservations [affirmative action]. So the opposition built this into a narrative about social justice. The voter, too, was beginning to express an exhaustion with the constant polarization and the constant authoritarianism. These were the messages that eroded support for Modi, and that’s where the election landed.

RA: If Modi does indeed form a government, he’ll have to rely on coalition allies. How do you think he and his party will approach power sharing? And what do you think that means for governance?

MV: We are truly in uncharted territory. Narendra Modi was the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, the state’s chief executive, for 13 years. He always had an overpowering single-party majority. When he transitioned to national life as prime minister in 2014, for the past 10 years, he has always had a dominant majority. Yes, he had coalition allies. They were extraneous. They were superfluous. He didn’t need them. He campaigned with them. He let them come along for the ride. He didn’t count on them to prove his majority on the floor of parliament.

We’re in a completely different scenario here. We have two political parties: the Telugu Desam Party, which is the ruling party in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and the Janata Dal (United), part of the ruling alliance with the BJP in the state of Bihar. Together, they have about 30 seats. They could make or break this government. So they are going to extract their pound of flesh. This is not something that Narendra Modi has a lot of practice doing. Those of us who have watched him over the past two decades are really not sure how he’s going to manage. His style of governance is very much top-down: centralizing power, working with the bureaucracy, cutting out members of the cabinet. But you’re now going to have your key coalition partners who are going to have important positions in the Council of Ministers.

All of a sudden, you may even have a party which has two seats in the national parliament of 543, which is going to say, “No, no, no. If I leave, this is going to hurt you.” We don’t know how he’s going to manage because he’s never had to do this before.

RA: Yamini, from the 1980s onward, most Indian administrations were coalition governments, and one can say that Modi between 2014 and 2024 was a sort of exception to that norm. How do coalition governments tend to do in India?

YA: Coalitions work in India because of the peculiar nature of India’s politics. As democracy deepened, coalition politics, state politics, regional politics became very important ways in which ethnic anxieties, linguistic anxieties, caste-related pressures for access to state power found accommodation. So it is really about the fundamental principle of democracy, which is a politics that becomes accommodative for a large country like India, with multiple fissures and deep forms of inequality. It sometimes can slow decision-making down.

I think that cooperation, dialogue, deliberation—which are at the heart of coalition politics—are good for India. It may mean that decisions cannot be taken immediately, but the decisions that are taken are more long-standing. So I don’t think there’s much for us to worry about. We have experienced dominance, we know its limits, and we know that it’s really important to have checks and balances. The Indian voters’ message, in my reading of this election, is a nuanced message. It’s a message that says, “Modi, we’re not completely giving up on you, but we don’t like how you’ve done stuff. So you’re a little bit on notice.” And to the opposition, “We’re kind of interested but not fully convinced, so you’re on notice, too.” It’s on both of them. So if the opposition, which is now a little stronger, uses parliament productively for serious debate, I think we will actually end up with far more useful economic reform. Our growth trajectory is at a place where much of what needs to be done requires cooperation with states, and so coalitions will help move us in that direction.

MV: The empirical evidence is very clear. Economic growth has been better and higher under coalition governments than single-party majorities. It is true that it is harder to enact new reforms, but it is also harder to undo old reforms. When you have a country that’s slowly moving in a more pro-market direction, I think it’s important. But the second part of what Yamini said is equally important, which is there’s also an institutional corollary here. When you have a more fragmented, multipolar political system, independent institutions like the Election Commission, like the Supreme Court, like the Reserve Bank of India, like various anti-corruption accountability institutions, they have space and don’t feel suffocated. They don’t feel the need to pay excessive deference to the ruling party. Some of these institutions, which have really not been very effective for the past 10 years, might start reclaiming some of that space back.

YA: But this is uncharted territory for Modi and his comrade in arms, Amit Shah. They have never been in a situation where they are not in total control. It really depends on how they read the mandate. Do they read the mandate like I do, as a nuanced mandate where the electorate is saying, “Some things you did, we don’t like, so stop.”? Or do they read it to say, as some of their Twitter trolls have been doing, which is, “The Hindus have let us down. Those cross-caste coalitions have let us down. Let’s go back to our core agenda.”? Will they then act as wounded animals and push back even further? They still have powers. It’s really about whether they shift their governance strategy or whether they double down, because now they are in a slightly weaker position and have to reestablish their dominance.

RA: What do you imagine other incumbent leaders around the world might draw from Modi’s relatively underwhelming performance this time?

MV: We always have this debate about whether, to defeat someone like [former U.S. President Donald] Trump, we need a counter-Trump on the Democratic side. One lesson in this election is, there is no leader to this opposition of more than two dozen parties. You don’t necessarily need another kind of larger-than-life personality to go against the incumbent populist leader. The second is that this was, in some ways, an issue-based campaign on the opposition side honed in on this idea of inequality. They stuck with it, and then they linked it to other issues. They linked it to reservation. They linked it to caste. They linked it to the two-speed economy. But they were pretty message-disciplined in talking about the core vulnerability of this government. That is, the headline numbers are beautiful, but you scratch the surface and there’s a lot of distress underneath. The third is, and it might seem somewhat flippant, but humor. There was a sense of mockery, of fun. You would have these doom-and-gloom speeches from the prime minister and others about how Muslims and other minorities were going to take your wealth away from you and redistribute amongst the masses. And the opposition would put out these parody videos with actors made to look like Amit Shah and Narendra Modi, poking fun!

RA: Yamini, it has been well documented that press freedom has declined in India in recent years. Reflect a little bit on whether there are limits to how leaders can deploy mass media to their advantage.

YA: There are certain pieces of an authoritarian playbook: Media control and money control are two critical ones, with civil society control being the third.

In mid-April, this social media influencer, whom I had heard about a little bit, just pops up. He’s like a kid sitting in Germany, straight out of Haryana, talking about dictatorship. And it was interesting. It was funny. I watched the whole thing. My mom, who’s over 80, called me up and said, “Have you watched it?” And then we both had a giggle. And then my colleague, Neelanjan [Sircar], with whom I wrote about this, we started going out into the field. We were in the middle of the rural hinterland of Uttar Pradesh, which is some of the poorest parts of India. Everybody now has a phone. And everywhere we went, there was at least one person, if not more, who was talking about this Dhruv Rathee and his videos. The videos were getting more and more powerful, and popping up more and more every day. We started asking people, “Where do you get your information? Where do you get your news?” We’ve seen this in other surveys, too. Anyone who was under the age of 45 was getting their news from YouTube and WhatsApp. And there’s a dark side to WhatsApp and YouTube, no doubt.

But in this instance, it increasingly began to be clear that people were looking for alternative spaces, alternative voices. And many of these were voices of people who had voted for BJP in 2019, voted for BJP in the state election in 2022, but were now increasingly talking about unemployment, dictatorship. There’s a word in Hindi, “tanashahi,”—dictatorship—that suddenly shows up everywhere, and that word became popular because of this social media influencer. We also found that even visible, hardcore BJP supporters, the local mobilizers, who if you pushed a little bit, they say, “Yes. TV media will only give you Modi, Modi, Modi.” So social media emerged as this alternative space. The right wing used to use it very effectively. In 2014, 2019, social media played a crucial role in harnessing the darker side of bigotry and hate speech. This time around, I’m not saying that went away, but the other side who were looking for other sources of information found a space to vent their frustrations or to hear views that were more aligned with their feelings through social media. That played a very important role in energizing voters who were feeling uncomfortable about what was going on.

RA: Assuming Modi is prime minister for another five years, do you expect his foreign policy to change or adapt, especially given that he will now be running a coalition government?

MV: I don’t think so. The structure of geopolitics right now is such that India just has a lot of room to maneuver. There are three big trends that we can point to. The first is declining American hegemony. We’re moving away from a kind of unipolar moment to a more multipolar, fragmented world order. Number two, clearly, is the increased concern, not least in India, but also the United States and Europe and other places, about Chinese expansionism and their alternate vision of the Indo-Pacific in Asia and the global order. And then third, of course, is the return of a more global Russia despite all of its problems. And so India finds itself in this geopolitical sweet spot, where it can pursue its policy. They’ve gone from calling it nonalignment to multi-alignment. But basically it pursues bespoke partnerships with particular countries in particular issues in domains. So working with the United States on defense technology at the same time that they can be importing Russian crude is the classic example. Those structural factors aren’t changing.

So the kind of assertiveness, the confidence, the brashness that you see from Indian diplomats connotes a sense that, to some degree, the world needs India more than India needs the world. Now, that has been heightened a bit because of the Modi government’s own arrogance, and that’s maybe been taken down a peg. But fundamentally I don’t think this changes much about the nature of India’s partnerships, what its priorities are, and who it seeks to work with.

RA: Nationalism has been such an important force in India, but particularly under the Modi government, that has morphed into jingoism. Do you expect that to change under a coalition government, or is it part of an Indian psyche that cuts across party lines?

YA: In the rush of trying to analyze why Modi was sort of “cut down to size,” as one newspaper headline put it, we also need to recognize that certain elements of what he has brought into Indian politics, in terms of the political dialogue and discourse, haven’t gone away. Jingoism and muscular nationalism—maybe the two are interconnected—and this idea that India has arrived on the global stage, shedding its sense of colonial victimhood, aggressive, that is something that resonated with voters. It’s treated as an achievement of this government. I don’t think voters have rejected it. I don’t know that voters have necessarily rejected the polarization, the bigotry, as much as just said, “This is not enough. We also want to hold you accountable for our everyday lives.”

So while the constitution went from being an abstract issue into something that was real with reservations, there are many other important things about liberalism, about freedoms, about liberty, about secularism that are very serious works in progress. Those have not found their way into the domain of mass politics. And I do think that there is a political consensus around muscular nationalism, particularly projected on the global stage.",Why Modi Underperformed,https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/06/06/india-election-modi-bjp-nda-coalition/
"['Pathi Covers India', 'The Wider South Asia Region. She Is Based In New Delhi.']","NEW DELHI (AP) — Since coming to power a decade ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been known for big, bold and often snap decisions that he’s found easy to execute thanks to the brute majority he enjoyed in India’s lower house of parliament.

In 2016, he yanked over 80% of bank notes from circulation in an effort to curb tax evasion that sent shockwaves through the country and devastated citizens who lost money. In 2019, his government pushed through a controversial law that stripped the special status of disputed, Muslim-majority Kashmir with hardly any debate in parliament. And in 2020, Modi swiftly brought in contentious agriculture reforms — though he was forced to drop those about a year later after mass protests from farmers.

In his expected next term as prime minister — when he will need a coalition to govern after results announced Wednesday showed his Hindu nationalist party fell short of a majority — Modi may have to adapt to a style of governance he has little experience with, or desire for.

And it’s not clear how that will play out.

“Negotiating and forming a coalition, working with coalition partners, grappling with the tradeoffs that come with coalition politics — none of this fits in well with Modi’s brand of assertive and go-it-alone politics,” said Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center’s South Asia Institute.

The surprising election results upended widespread expectations before the vote and exit polls that suggested a stronger showing for Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. In the end, the party won 240 seats — short of the 272 needed to form the government on its own. But the coalition it belongs to, the National Democratic Alliance, secured a majority in the 543-seat lower house that should allow Modi to retain power in the world’s most populous nation.

“India cuts Modi down,” read one Indian newspaper headline on Wednesday, referring to the 642 million voters as well as the opposing INDIA alliance, which clawed seats away from the BJP.

This is both a major setback and unknown territory for Modi, who has never needed his coalition partners to govern since first becoming prime minister in 2014. It has left him the most vulnerable he has been in his 23-year political career.

“These results show that the Modi wave has receded, revealing a level of electoral vulnerability that many could not have foreseen,” said Kugelman.

India has a history of messy coalition governments — but Modi, who has enjoyed astronomical popularity, offered a respite, leading his BJP to landslide victories in the last two elections. His supporters credit him with transforming the country into an emerging global power, matched by a robust economy that’s the world’s fifth-largest.

That economy, however, is in some trouble — and fixing it will now require partners. His opponents focused on vulnerabilities despite the brisk growth, like unemployment, inflation and inequality — but his campaign offered few clues to how he might address those.

“Modi hardly addressed the question of unemployment — they skirted around it,” said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.

It’s not just that Modi will have to adapt to relying on a coalition. The election has also left him diminished after he spent a decade building a persona of absolute invincibility, said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

At the heart of his governance style has been his penchant for control, critics say, adding that Modi has increasingly centralized power.

But now to stay in power, Modi will have to do whatever he can to maintain a stable coalition, meaning he may have to govern in a way that is more collaborative since the smaller regional parties in his alliance could make or break his government.

The BJP’s lackluster performance is “undoubtedly a slap in the face,” Vaishnav said, of Modi, who confidently predicted at his first election rally in February that the party would secure more than 370 seats — 130 more than it did.

The gap between the high expectations Modi and others set for the BJP and its actual performance has left the victors looking like losers and the defeated feeling victorious.

Still, Vaishnav said “we shouldn’t lose sight that the BJP is still in the driver’s seat.”

To be sure, his most consequential Hindu nationalist policies and actions are locked in — including a controversial citizenship law and Hindu temple built atop a razed mosque. His critics and opponents decry those policies, saying they have bred intolerance and stoked religious tensions against the country’s Muslim community — and left India’s democracy faltering, with dissent silenced and the media squeezed.

Now, his agenda, and ability to push through policies going forward could face fiercer challenges, especially from a once deflated but now resurgent opposition.

The INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party, will likely have more power to apply pressure and push back, especially in parliament where their numbers will grow.

“Modi is Modi. But I would say that with the attitude with which he ran the country until now, he will definitely face some problems now,” said Anand Mohan Singh, a 45-year-old businessman in the capital, New Delhi. “Some changes will be visible.”

[],"Why India's Modi failed to win outright majority

4 June 2024 By Soutik Biswas , @soutikBBC, India correspondent Share

Indian PM Narendra Modi has won a third consecutive term in a much tighter general election than anticipated. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks set to fall short of a majority and is leading in the 543-seat parliament, below the required 272 seats. However its coalition partners have gained additional seats. The results are a personal blow to Mr Modi, who has always secured majorities in elections as both chief minister of Gujarat state and India’s prime minister, and dominated the country's politics for a decade. The verdict marks a surprising revival for the Congress Party-led INDIA opposition alliance, defying earlier predictions of its decline, and sharply diverging from both exit polls and pre-election surveys. More than 640 million people voted in a marathon seven-week election, hailed as a ""world record"" by election authorities. Nearly half of the voters were women.

Many world leaders have crawled across the finishing line in their third term elections and Mr Modi is no exception. The BJP remains India’s single largest party by seats, and if Mr Modi secures a third term with his allies, the prime minister matches the record of Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first premier. But the significant loss of seats for his party - more than 50 - dims the allure of a third term, especially given Mr Modi's campaign targeting 400 coalition seats, making anything less seem like an under-achievement. This has led to jubilation in the Congress camp and some despair in BJP quarters. Despite the BJP emerging as the single largest party, the burden of hype and expectations has left many of their supporters disheartened. Mr Modi's supporters believe securing a third term can be attributed to several factors: a record of stable governance, the appeal of continuity, efficient welfare programmes, and the perception that he has enhanced India's global image. To his Hindu nationalist base, Mr Modi delivered on key manifesto promises: revoking the autonomy of Indian-administered Kashmir, building the Ram temple in Ayodhya and implementing a controversial citizenship law. Many BJP-ruled states have implemented laws tightening regulations on interfaith marriages.

The BJP's significant drop in seats may be linked to joblessness, rising prices, growing inequality and a controversial army recruitment reform, among other things. Mr Modi's harsh and divisive campaign, particularly targeting Muslims, could also have alienated voters in some regions. His ambitious slogan ""Ab ki baar, 400 paar,"" aiming for more than 400 seats for his NDA alliance, may have backfired, with such a massive majority raising fears of constitutional changes among the poor. Mr Modi’s party faced its largest setback in Uttar Pradesh (UP), a state larger than the United Kingdom and three times as populous. With 80 parliamentary seats, UP holds significant sway in national politics - many consider it the gateway to Delhi. Both Mr Modi and Rahul Gandhi hold seats there.

So what are the main takeaways of this election? A dent of Brand Modi Mr Modi’s popularity has been also attributed to his mastery of branding, transforming routine events into spectacles and astute messaging. A weak opposition and a largely friendly media also helped him build his brand. The election results show that Brand Modi has lost some of its shine, indicating that even Mr Modi is susceptible to anti-incumbency. In other words, he is not as invincible as many of his supporters believed. This offers renewed hope to the opposition. A return to coalition politics India has a history of chaotic coalition governments, although some in the early 1990s and 2000s played a significant role in implementing economic reforms. If the BJP forms the government, it will be dependent on allies and will need to adopt a more consultative and deliberative approach. This dependency makes it vulnerable to collapse if allies feel neglected. The party, once perceived as all-powerful, is now reliant on allies, unlike in 2014 and 2019.

A jolt to the dominant BJP Mr Modi's uninterrupted decade-long reign at the top has underscored India's embrace of what some political scientists term the one-party dominant system. This has five key traits: a charismatic leader, unrivaled control over resources and communication, unmatched organisational machinery, and an opposition in disarray. Shrinking freedoms also characterise a one-party dominant system. Mr Modi’s BJP is not the first party to dominate Indian politics. For many years after Independence the Congress ruled without a break. Tuesday’s result has restored India to what many consider ""normal politics"", with a range of parties sharing and competing for power.

A resurgent opposition The results will energise the much-criticised Congress-led opposition. In February, the diverse coalition known as INDIA, short for Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, faced turmoil when one of its key leaders, Nitish Kumar, exited - only to later rejoin the BJP. But led by Rahul Gandhi, the opposition ran a spirited campaign and narrowed the gap, in the face of a partisan media and despite fewer resources. There is more hope for them ahead. The BJP holds about a third of India’s 4,000- plus state assembly seats and has lost to regional parties before. Over the next 14 months, five states are set for elections - all could be keenly contested. With contests in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, and Haryana this year, the BJP could face substantial competition. Delhi's upcoming election may pose challenges, while Bihar in October presents a regional hurdle.
